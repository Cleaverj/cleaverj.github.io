<h1>Hello Internet!</h1>
<p>My name is Jacob Cleaver</p>
<p>This is my first time making a website so bear with the poor appearance. It should be better next time you stop by!</p>
<p>Here are links to my linkedin and github accounts:</p>

<a href="https://github.com/Cleaverj">github</a>

<h2>Daily Updates on Website Progress</h2>
<p>09/08/2023: Created html, css, and js files. Learned how to link Github and VS Code, commit and push changes, 
    and create/merge branches. Created headers, paragraphs, and added links to social media pages.</p>

<h2>Other Current Projects</h2>
<p>I am also learning the Wolfram Language for Mathematica. I am following along with the book 'An Elementary Introduction to
    the Wolfram Language' by Stephen Wolfram.</p>
<p>My goal will be to post a link to a published document for every set of 6 chapters. Here is the link to the first set of
    chapters I have completed.
